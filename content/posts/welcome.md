## Welcome {#welcome}


### As part of updating the Emacs-SF github organization's meetup-notes repository, {#as-part-of-updating-the-emacs-sf-github-organization-s-meetup-notes-repository}

I've enabled the Discussions tab there, and the wiki pages are now publicly editable.
I've also created the Emacs-SF.github.io repository for publishing the blog.
And I've created the ox-hugo-blog-content repository for the actual org files that
the blog posts are generated from.
