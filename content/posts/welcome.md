## Welcome {#welcome}


### What's new {#what-s-new}

As part of updating the Emacs-SF github organization's meetup-notes repository:

-   I've enabled the Discussions tab there, and the wiki pages are now publicly editable.
-   I've also created the Emacs-SF.github.io repository for publishing the blog.
-   I've created the ox-hugo-blog-content repository for the actual org files that

the blog posts are generated from.


### In progress {#in-progress}

-   customizing the site; adding a sidebar with categories/tags
-   adding meta content
-   linking to meeting notes
